---

## 2. Literature Review (Pages 3–6)

Here you get a quick overview of:
- Earlier blind-assist systems
- Ultrasonic detection ideas
- Vision-based navigation systems
- Smart canes developed in past research

This shows how your project compares to existing solutions.

---

## 3. How the Smart Stick Works (Pages 6–7)

This is where the main concept is explained:
- How ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles
- How Arduino measures distance
- How the buzzer and vibration motor alert the user
- Why alert frequency increases as the obstacle gets closer

This chapter gives a clear idea of the core working principle.

---

## 4. Hardware & Software Details (Pages 8–12)

This part lists and explains every component used:
- Arduino UNO  
- Ultrasonic sensors  
- Buzzer  
- LEDs  
- Vibration motor  
- Power supply  
- Arduino IDE  
- Tinkercad simulator  

Useful for anyone who wants to rebuild the project.

## 5. Block Diagram & Methodology (Pages 13–14)

This section shows:
- The full system flow
- How sensor signals travel to Arduino
- How output feedback is generated
- The step-by-step approach used during development

It gives a “big picture” view of how all hardware fits together.

---

## 6. Results & Observations (Pages 15–17)

Here you will find:
- Ultrasonic timing diagrams
- Distance testing results
- Actual vs calculated distance accuracy
- Behaviour of the stick during real usage

This helps you understand performance and reliability.

---

## 7. Applications, Advantages & Limitations (Pages 17–18)

Covers real-world practicality:
- Where the stick can be used
- Major advantages (simple, low-cost, fast response)
- Limitations (cannot detect downward holes, limited range)

This gives a realistic view of where the stick works well and where it doesn’t.

---

## 8. Conclusion & Future Scope (Pages 18–20)

Summarizes the entire project and suggests improvements like:
- Adding GPS/GSM
- IoT integration
- Solar charging
- Wheels for navigation
- Camera-based object detection

This is great if someone wants to extend the project further.
